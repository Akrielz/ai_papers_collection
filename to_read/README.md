# AI Papers Collection

This is a list of papers that I plan to read. Once read, I move them to the
[already_read](already_read/README.md) folder.

The available tags are: 
- `#CV` for computer vision
- `#NLP` for natural language processing
- `#BIO` for bioinformatics
- `#AUDIO` for audio processing
- `#AL` for active learning
- `#RL` for reinforcement learning
- `#GM` for generative models
- `#LLM` for large language models

Warning: Because I didn't finish reading them, the tags might be wrong.
